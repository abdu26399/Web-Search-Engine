# Web-Search-Engine
Web Search Engine using Java 
In the project for Advanced Computing Concepts, I designed and developed a web search engine using Java. The search engine incorporated important concepts such as page ranking, pattern matching, and web crawling, to provide relevant and accurate results.
The page ranking algorithm was implemented to prioritize and display the most relevant websites at the top of the search results.
The pattern matching technique was used to search the web pages for specific keywords and the web crawling process was used to gather information from different websites.
Overall, this project showcased my proficiency in advanced computing concepts and my ability to apply them in real-world applications.
